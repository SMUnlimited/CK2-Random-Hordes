# Crusader Kings 2 Random Hordes Mod

Randomly spawns a massive army for random AI chracters throughout the years. 
Now fear not just the mongols but any war focused character. 

##Mechanics 
- Every 15 years or so there is a 3% chance for an AI character to gather a massive army. There are a number of rules to the characters chosen: 
- The ruler must be a Duke or a Count (or nomadic)
- If the ruler is war focused (only if you own the way of life dlc) or has particularly agressive traits or ambition this chance can increase up to 10%. 
- Non Reformed Pagan Rulers and tribes 25% more likely to be chosen. 
- Christian rulers 50% less likely to be chosen. 
- Certain non ambitious or illness/health traits will prevent a character ever being chosen. 
- Characters must be between 16 and 60, although characters over the age of 45 are less likely to be chosen.

The number of troops spawned scales based on the year and the characters current troop count but it will be between 11000 and 130000 troops. 

The ruler will also gain a cb to subjugate those of the same religion for 50 years (non reformed pagans can subjugate everyone). Subjugation will help prevent a game over when your same religion neighbour turns into a horde. 
During those 50 years no other horde will spawn. 
If the ruler dies, his heir will not have access to the subjugation cb anymore. 

The spawned armies will be slightly affected by attrition. 

If a christian turns into a horde there is a likelyhood the pope will excommunicate him if he or she uses the subjugation cb especially if he or she is disliked by the pope. 

A random horde will have a reduced change of spawning during the time frames of the major mongol horde events (aztecs excluded) 

Hopefully the spawn rate and number of troops spawned strikes a good balance to give the hordes the ability to expand without it happening too often and without them easily taking out other empires of the time. 

## Configuration
There is a configuration option to restrict hordes in the intrigue menu. This will reduce the troop counts of hordes and scale better to the characters current army size. 

This option will work well with shattered balance mods where army sizes will start smaller making this more balanced than the standard spawn rates.

##Mod Compatability 
High Compatability. This mod is just events and a new casus belli so should hopefully be compatible with most mods. 

Works with ck2 version 2.4.2 "Provided for fun by The Strategy Master"
